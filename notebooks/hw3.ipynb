    "# Homework 3\n",
    "CS 510 Large Language Models - Winter 2024\n",
    "Bradley Thompson\n",

    "## 1 - Dataset Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the dataset, the authors utilized the Twitter API to retrieve 198 million tweets posted between May 2018 and March 2020. The original dataset included tweets in over thirty languages. It was filtered to consider only tweets with at least three tokens and without URLs to exclude bot tweets and spam advertising. Further, to create a balanced dataset for sentiment analysis, the authors made 8 distinct\n",
    "monolingual datasets. To ensure balance, a maximum number of tweets were established based on the size of the smallest dataset (3,033 tweets for Hindi) -- all other languages' datasets were pruned. The resulting dataset consists of 1,839 training tweets and 870 testing tweets, with a total size of 24,262 tweets. In terms of label distribution, the dataset was created with an equal distribution across the three labels, and the distribution is maintained throughout the train, test and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few potential weaknesses of the annotation process are:\n",
    "- Intermixing languages with diverse scripts (only Arabic from a separate language family) could make it tough for the model to perform well on sentiment analysis tasks.\n",
    "- The labeling process itself is subjective, because an emotional interpretation of a given tweet's sentiment comes down to the annotator, and may not accurately track the tweet's actual sentiment. This is exacerbated by cultural differences between language speaking populations.\n",
    "- Aside from that, there isn't much information in the paper about the actual annotation process, specifically about the annotators themselves, so we can't know how qualified they were to analyze tweet sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 - Language Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "| Language | Family | Resource Level (High / Low)|\n",
    "|----------|--------|----------------------------|\n",
    "|Arabic|Afro-Asiatic|Low|\n",
    "|English|Indo-European|High|\n",
    "|French|Indo-European|High|\n",
    "|German|Indo-European|High|\n",
    "|Hindi|Indo-European|Low|\n",
    "|Italian|Indo-European|Low|\n",
    "|Portoguese|Indo-European|Low|\n",
    "|Spanish|Indo-European|High\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, I believe that the high resource level languages will perform best, and I believe Arabic will perform significantly\n",
    "worse. This is a result of the overwhelming representation of data in the \"Indo-European\" family: Because these languages all will share common traits, it's possible that multi-language models will benefit from an understanding built on shared language patterns. Conversely, the only language (again, Arabic) representing an entirely different language family will garner no such benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from these highlights, below I include the languages ranked from highest to lowest, as well as my thoughts on why I ranked each language as such inline:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Language | Notes |\n",
    "|------|----------|-------|\n",
    "|1|English|Obvious choice; Highest representation in data online|\n",
    "|2|Spanish|Close call with French/German, but wins because more Spanish speaking countries, so probably more representation|\n",
    "|3|French|Similar to German, but subjectively, seems like it could be more emotive, which will help with sentiment analysis|\n",
    "|4|German|Last slot of the high resource languages|\n",
    "|5|Hindi|Subjectively, I think this would be the highest representation low resource language|\n",
    "|6|Portoguese|Close behind Hindi, also because of assumed representation online|\n",
    "|7|Italian|I imagine that this is the lowest representation Indo-European language|\n",
    "|8|Arabic|Reasons referenced in preceding paragraph|\n",
    "\n",
    "On second read-through of the assignment, I realized that I only need to use languages from the Indo-European family. I'm leaving in the Arabic analysis because it\n",
    "still seems relevant as the language is included as a subset of the available data, regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 - Multilingual Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a base case before investigating advanced prompting strategies, I started out with simple / regular prompting for the sentiment analysis task. The models we are studying are OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 and Google's Gemini.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt that I used for the base case is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given this json array of strings containing tweets, can you analyze the tweet's sentiment and label it as POSITIVE, or NEGATIVE?\n",
    "[Array of texts here]\n",
    "Please organize the texts alongside the result Sentiment label in a python dict so that I can easily turn the results into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And I used the following code cells to import the dataset and organize it by label. I then pulled out data for use in subsequent prompting on the web UI for both models."

Gemini tried to give me some crappy code to evaluate the sentiment of the texts based on the presence of a few words that it associated into categories (e.g. if text contains \"bad\" or \"hate\" then it is negative, if it contains \"great\" or \"love\" then it is positive\").\n",

    "Chain of thought prompting, interestingly, made ChatGPT perform worse. It seems the the additional information confused the model, as the inclusion of the key points it came up with introduced nuance to the sentiment analysis task. Subjectively, it seems that the samples that caused it to introduce a third, unspecified label for (NEUTRAL) were all fairly neutral to be in the corresponding set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, from the positive set, ChatGPT categorized \"Better be with Kendrick Lamar\" as neutral. The annotators classified it is positive. I think positive is more correct based on assumed cultural context; however, the language used here leaves it open to interpretation and the tone could change wildly based on context. For example, I'd consider this a negative sentiment tweet if it was prefaced with something like \"Miss me with this modern trash mumble rap -- Better be with Kendrick Lamar.\" I think given the wild swing in sentiment possible from this tweet, which honestly seems like a snippet of a larger post anyway, the model was justified in labeling this as NEUTRAL. While the example I provided was not the actual tweet, it still goes to show that the model points out and will potentially be more focused on more nuanced language patterns given the chain-of-thought that it builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example to further this point, and which also highlights the subjectivity dataset annotation, is actually the direct chain-of-thought provided for the following sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The tragedy of only thinking up hilarious tweets for the Summer Olympics now is that in four years there may be no place for them\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's label: Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning: The tweet is humorous and acknowledges the limitation of tweeting about the Summer Olympics only every four years.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading ChatGPT's justification, I honestly agree more with it than the annotator. I think this simply highlights the difficulty of sentiment analysis given the weaknesses discussed at the start of the assignment, and indicates that even though my statistical analysis (Accuracy, precision, recall) might prove worse over time as I try out these advanced prompting techniques -- because of the dataset annotation -- the true performance of the models may actually improve in a more holistic sense (not trusting the annotator's word on a tweet's sentiment, but arriving at a more accurate categorization).\n"

    "Chain of thought prompting resulted in a marked improvement in performance for Gemini, in that it was able to complete the task to some extent. Gemini was not able to understand my instructions to help speed up data collection, choosing to provide some bad sentiment analysis code snippets instead; however, it was able to at least provide categories for each text, which I could then copy down manually. Interestingly, it added a fourth label \"Mixed\" which also wasn't mentioned in the prompt. I grouped in the mixed samples with neutral.\n",

The annotator it seems was very rash to consider this a solely positive tweet; Perhaps Gemini is right and this tweet was actually making fun of the quality of someone's photos. We can't really tell, but that further captures the fact that there's nuance to this sample which is not captured by the annotators label. \n",

    "While ChatGPT's performance was statistically hindered, it does still seem to have become more capable in understanding language sentiment nuance in it's findings given the emotional prompt. It flagged many of the same samples in the negative subset that both models pointed out as naunced (neutral or mixed) in chain-of-thought prompting, when the models expressed reasoning as to why the models may not be entirely correct in a category of POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. This exemplifies that the models do have some implicit understanding of the semantics behind the language they analyze, even when not asked to explicitly generate an explanation of those semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the added subjective importance of the emotional prompt has maybe caused the model to spend more computation on evaluating the sentiment of the statements. It would be interesting to spend more dedicated time researching some way to identify the difference in characteristics the model cares about under the different prompt paradigms. For example, when there's no emotional importance expressed, does the model only analyze sentiment based on simple heuristics (contains x, y, z words), and then with the importance of the result stressed, does the model analyze more complex concepts like tone, speech target, context?"

It instead tried to generate a dumb sentiment analysis script in Python that used word presence checks to determine sentiment. The model itself did no sentiment analysis.
